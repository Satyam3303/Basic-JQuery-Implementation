                <p>Set in a reimagining of 1500s Sengoku era Japan. An unnamed shinobi, tasked with protecting a young lord of mystical lineage,

                    Set after the rise of the Ashina Empire in 1500's Sengouku Era Japan. Sekiro follows the story of Wolf, a Shinobi tasked with protecting Kuro, a young lord of mysterious lineage from whom he
                     was separated after being left for dead, as the land of the Ashina begins to fall to its enemies.

            <h1>Preface</h1>
            <p>Japan is fractured into many independent nations entangled in ceaseless war. 
                Beyond endless snowy peaks lies the land of Ashina - a realm rife with sacred earth and ancient mystery.
                For years the Ashina were overrun by invaders and forced to serve foreign lords.</p> 
            
            <p>
                That is until twenty years ago, when Sword Saint Isshin Ashina ignited a bloody coup to retake his homeland. Isshin's skill with a blade was unrivaled, and he inspired fierce loyalty in his countrymen. Under his leadership Ashina was reclaimed by it's rightful rulers and a new time of peace began.
                But now, Ashina once again faces an invasive threat. One more powerful than any before it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Interior Ministry has set it's sights on Ashina and will stop at nothing to unify all of Japan under one banner. Genichiro Ashina, Isshin's grandson, has assumed command and desperately searches for a means to defend his home.
                Soon though, he realizes the inevitable: “Ashina cannot be defended by normal means, not anymore.”
            </p>

            <p>
                And so the Divine Heir is kidnapped,
                alone in the world save for a single shinobi.
                His loyal wolf - Sekiro.
